# Waiter-Robot-
This project is a smart food delivery robot built using Arduino. It uses IR sensors, ultrasonic sensor, and a color sensor (TCS3200) for navigation, obstacle detection, and table identification. The robot delivers food trays to tables marked with colors (RED, GREEN, BLUE) and returns back to the kitchen after delivery.
